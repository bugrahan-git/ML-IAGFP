<p>In daily life, we all wonder about artworks and ask ourselves who is the artist of this and which movement it belongs to. If you are not an art expert you probably can not find an answer to these questions. In this project, we are going to focus on paintings. We thought that we could solve this problem with machine learning. We are going to concentrate on the identification of cubism, realism, abstract, fauvism, impressionism, and neoclassicism artworks with various artists using over 4000 unique paintings.</p>
